[`confd`](http://confd.io) is a lightweight configuration management tool focused on:

* keeping local configuration files up-to-date using data stored in etcd, consul, dynamodb, redis, vault, zookeeper, aws ssm parameter store or env vars and processing template resources.
* reloading applications to pick up new config file changes
